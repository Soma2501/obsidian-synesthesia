# obsidian-synesthesia

NOTE: This theme is currently in active, experimental development. Breaking changes are frequent and expected.

Goals of this theme:

1. Security-First Features:
   - Experiment with better security for obsidian, particularly via linting.
   - If there are any useful plugins that can be implemented without javascript, to attempt to implement these exclusively in CSS to reduce unnecessary attack surfaces.
   - See:
     - https://defensivecss.dev/
     - https://docs.obsidian.md/Themes/App+themes/Theme+guidelines

2. Material Design Principles:
   - Integrate design philosophies from Material Design v2 and v3 where appropriate
   - See:
     - https://m2.material.io/design/guidelines-overview
     - https://m3.material.io/get-started

3. Declarative Configuration with Style Settings
   - Toggle presets, color themes, layout options, etc decleratively to enable easy import/export of configurations
   - See:
     - https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings

4. Experimental opt-in customization options (that may be less secure but more adaptive or integrate with other plugins)
